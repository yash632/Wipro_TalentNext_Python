# Stream: Python
# Tech Module: Data Structure
# Project: 3
# You have a record of n students. Each record contains the student's name, and
# their percent marks in Math, Physics and Chemistry. The marks can be floating
# values. You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type.
# Student's name is the key. Marks stored in a list is the value. The user enters a
# student's name. Output the average percentage marks obtained by that
# student.
# Formula: (sum of marks) / (no of subjects)
# Sample input: { "Krishna" : [67, 68, 69],
# "Arjun" : [70, 98, 63],
# "Malika" : [52, 56, 60] }
# Sample output:
# Enter a name: Malika
# Average percentage mark: 56
# Explanation:
# Marks for Malika are [52, 56, 60] whose average is (52 + 56 + 60) / 3 => 56
